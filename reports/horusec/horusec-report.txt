(2/4) * Possible vulnerability detected: Origins should be verified during cross-origin communications
Browsers allow message exchanges between Window objects of different origins. Because any window can send / receive messages from other window it is important to verify the sender's / receiver's identity: When sending message with postMessage method, the identity's receiver should be defined (the wildcard keyword (*) should not be used).
When receiving message with message event, the sender's identity should be verified using the origin and possibly source properties. For more information checkout the OWASP A2:2017 (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A2_2017-Broken_Authentication) and (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) advisory.
         
(3/4) * Possible vulnerability detected: Debugger statements should not be used
The debugger statement can be placed anywhere in procedures to suspend execution. Using the debugger statement is similar to setting a breakpoint in the code. By definition such statement must absolutely be removed from the source code to prevent any unexpected behavior or added vulnerability to attacks in production. For more information checkout the CWE-489 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/489.html) advisory.
         
(4/4) * Possible vulnerability detected: No Log Sensitive Information in console
The App logs information. Sensitive information should never be logged. For more information checkout the CWE-532 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html) advisory.

(3/5) * Possible vulnerability detected: No use weak random number generator
When software generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information. As the Math.random() function relies on a weak pseudorandom number generator, this function should not be used for security-critical applications or for protecting sensitive data. In such context, a cryptographically strong pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) should be used instead. For more information checkout the CWE-338 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html) advisory.
         
(4/5) * Possible vulnerability detected: Insecure download of executable file
Downloading executables or other sensitive files over an unencrypted connection can leave a server open to man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM). Such an attack can allow an attacker to insert arbitrary content into the downloaded file, and in the worst case, allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system..

Details: (1/8) * Possible vulnerability detected: Hard-coded password
The software contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key, which it uses for its own inbound authentication, outbound communication to external components, or encryption of internal data. For more information checkout the CWE-798 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html) advisory.
         
(2/8) * Possible vulnerability detected: Origins should be verified during cross-origin communications
Browsers allow message exchanges between Window objects of different origins. Because any window can send / receive messages from other window it is important to verify the sender's / receiver's identity: When sending message with postMessage method, the identity's receiver should be defined (the wildcard keyword (*) should not be used).
When receiving message with message event, the sender's identity should be verified using the origin and possibly source properties. For more information checkout the OWASP A2:2017 (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A2_2017-Broken_Authentication) and (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) advisory.
         
(3/8) * Possible vulnerability detected: Debugger statements should not be used
The debugger statement can be placed anywhere in procedures to suspend execution. Using the debugger statement is similar to setting a breakpoint in the code. By definition such statement must absolutely be removed from the source code to prevent any unexpected behavior or added vulnerability to attacks in production. For more information checkout the CWE-489 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/489.html) advisory.
         
(4/8) * Possible vulnerability detected: Alert statements should not be used
alert(...) as well as confirm(...) and prompt(...) can be useful for debugging during development, but in production mode this kind of pop-up could expose sensitive information to attackers, and should never be displayed. For more information checkout the CWE-489 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/489.html) advisory.

For more information checkout the CWE-829 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html) advisory.
         
(7/8) * Possible vulnerability detected: Local storage should not be used
Session storage and local storage are HTML 5 features which allow developers to easily store megabytes of data client-side, as opposed to the 4Kb cookies can accommodate. While useful to speed applications up on the client side, it can be dangerous to store sensitive information this way because the data is not encrypted by default and any script on the page may access it. This rule raises an issue when the localStorage and sessionStorage API's are used. For more information checkout the OWSAP A3:2017 (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A3_2017-Sensitive_Data_Exposure.html) advisory.

Details: (1/1) * Possible vulnerability detected: No use weak random number generator
When software generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information. As the Math.random() function relies on a weak pseudorandom number generator, this function should not be used for security-critical applications or for protecting sensitive data. In such context, a cryptographically strong pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) should be used instead.

Details: (1/1) * Possible vulnerability detected: SQL Injection
SQL queries often need to use a hardcoded SQL string with a dynamic parameter coming from a user request. Formatting a string to add those parameters to the request is a bad practice as it can result in an SQL injection. The safe way to add parameters to a SQL query is to use SQL binding mechanisms.

Details: (1/1) * Possible vulnerability detected: No use weak random number generator
When software generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information. As the Math.random() function relies on a weak pseudorandom number generator, this function should not be used for security-critical applications or for protecting sensitive data. In such context, a cryptographically strong pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) should be used instead.

Details: (1/1) * Possible vulnerability detected: SQL Injection
SQL queries often need to use a hardcoded SQL string with a dynamic parameter coming from a user request. Formatting a string to add those parameters to the request is a bad practice as it can result in an SQL injection. The safe way to add parameters to a SQL query is to use SQL binding mechanisms. For more information checkout the CWE-564 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/564.html) and OWASP A1:2017 (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A1_2017-Injection.html) advisory.

Details: (1/1) * Possible vulnerability detected: No use MD5 hashing
The MD5 hash algorithm that was used is considered weak. It can also cause hash collisions. It is always recommended to use some CHF (Cryptographic Hash Function), which is mathematically strong and not reversible. SHA512 would be the most recommended hash for storing the password and it is also important to adopt some type of Salt, so that the Hash is more secure.

Details: (1/1) * Possible vulnerability detected: No use weak random number generator
When software generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information. As the Math.random() function relies on a weak pseudorandom number generator, this function should not be used for security-critical applications or for protecting sensitive data. In such context, a cryptographically strong pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) should be used instead.

Because any window can send / receive messages from other window it is important to verify the sender's / receiver's identity: When sending message with postMessage method, the identity's receiver should be defined (the wildcard keyword (*) should not be used).
When receiving message with message event, the sender's identity should be verified using the origin and possibly source properties. For more information checkout the OWASP A2:2017 (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A2_2017-Broken_Authentication) and (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) advisory.
         
(2/3) * Possible vulnerability detected: No use weak random number generator
When software generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information. As the Math.random() function relies on a weak pseudorandom number generator, this function should not be used for security-critical applications or for protecting sensitive data. In such context, a cryptographically strong pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) should be used instead. For more information checkout the CWE-338 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html) advisory.
         
(3/3) * Possible vulnerability detected: No Log Sensitive Information in console
The App logs information. Sensitive information should never be logged. For more information checkout the CWE-532 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html) advisory.

The MD5 hash algorithm that was used is considered weak. It can also cause hash collisions. It is always recommended to use some CHF (Cryptographic Hash Function), which is mathematically strong and not reversible.

Details: (1/1) * Possible vulnerability detected: No use weak random number generator
When software generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information. As the Math.random() function relies on a weak pseudorandom number generator, this function should not be used for security-critical applications or for protecting sensitive data. In such context, a cryptographically strong pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) should be used instead.

Details: (1/1) * Possible vulnerability detected: Alert statements should not be used
alert(...) as well as confirm(...) and prompt(...) can be useful for debugging during development, but in production mode this kind of pop-up could expose sensitive information to attackers, and should never be displayed. For more information checkout the CWE-489 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/489.html) advisory.

Details: (1/2) * Possible vulnerability detected: Origins should be verified during cross-origin communications
Browsers allow message exchanges between Window objects of different origins. Because any window can send / receive messages from other window it is important to verify the sender's / receiver's identity: When sending message with postMessage method, the identity's receiver should be defined (the wildcard keyword (*) should not be used).
When receiving message with message event, the sender's identity should be verified using the origin and possibly source properties. For more information checkout the OWASP A2:2017 (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A2_2017-Broken_Authentication) and (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) advisory.
         
(2/2) * Possible vulnerability detected: Debugger statements should not be used
The debugger statement can be placed anywhere in procedures to suspend execution. Using the debugger statement is similar to setting a breakpoint in the code. By definition such statement must absolutely be removed from the source code to prevent any unexpected behavior or added vulnerability to attacks in production. For more information checkout the CWE-489 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/489.html) advisory.

Details: (1/1) * Possible vulnerability detected: No use weak random number generator
When software generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information. As the Math.random() function relies on a weak pseudorandom number generator, this function should not be used for security-critical applications or for protecting sensitive data. In such context, a cryptographically strong pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) should be used instead.

ReferenceHash: c62fe27424cb125bf94b67ec5c549983e8ac43b9e03d9738d9015cfd70d59ed9
Details: (1/1) * Possible vulnerability detected: No use weak random number generator
When software generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information. As the Math.random() function relies on a weak pseudorandom number generator, this function should not be used for security-critical applications or for protecting sensitive data. In such context, a cryptographically strong pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) should be used instead. For more information checkout the CWE-338 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html) advisory.

Details: (1/1) * Possible vulnerability detected: Insecure download of executable file
Downloading executables or other sensitive files over an unencrypted connection can leave a server open to man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM). Such an attack can allow an attacker to insert arbitrary content into the downloaded file, and in the worst case, allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.. For more information checkout the CWE-829 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html) advisory.

Details: (1/1) * Possible vulnerability detected: No use .get method using data from request of user input
Allows user input data to be used as parameters for the 'request.get' method. Without proper handling, it could cause a Server Side Request Forgery vulnerability. Which is a type of exploitation in which an attacker abuses the functionality of a server, causing it to access or manipulate information in that server's domain. For more information checkout the CWE-918 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html) advisory.
