          Untrusted input might be used to build a database query, which can lead to a SQL injection         
          vulnerability. An attacker can execute malicious SQL statements and gain unauthorized access to    
          sensitive data, modify, delete data, or execute arbitrary system commands. To prevent this         
          vulnerability, use prepared statements that do not concatenate user-controllable strings and use   
          parameterized queries where SQL commands and user data are strictly separated. Also, consider using

          Untrusted input might be used to build a database query, which can lead to a SQL injection         
          vulnerability. An attacker can execute malicious SQL statements and gain unauthorized access to    
          sensitive data, modify, delete data, or execute arbitrary system commands. To prevent this         
          vulnerability, use prepared statements that do not concatenate user-controllable strings and use   
          parameterized queries where SQL commands and user data are strictly separated. Also, consider using

          The application builds a file path from potentially untrusted data, which can lead to a path        
          traversal vulnerability. An attacker can manipulate the path which the application uses to access   
          files. If the application does not validate user input and sanitize file paths, sensitive files such
          as configuration or user data can be accessed, potentially creating or overwriting files. To prevent
          this vulnerability, validate and sanitize any input that is used to create references to file paths.
          Also, enforce strict file access controls. For example, choose privileges allowing public-facing    
          applications to access only the required files.

          Untrusted input might be used to build a database query, which can lead to a SQL injection         
          vulnerability. An attacker can execute malicious SQL statements and gain unauthorized access to    
          sensitive data, modify, delete data, or execute arbitrary system commands. To prevent this         
          vulnerability, use prepared statements that do not concatenate user-controllable strings and use   
          parameterized queries where SQL commands and user data are strictly separated. Also, consider using
          an object-relational (ORM) framework to operate with safer abstractions.

          Detected user input used to manually construct a SQL string. This is usually bad practice because 
          manual construction could accidentally result in a SQL injection. An attacker could use a SQL     
          injection to steal or modify contents of the database. Instead, use a parameterized query which is
          available by default in most database engines. Alternatively, consider using an object-relational 
          mapper (ORM) such as Sequelize which will protect your queries.

          The application builds a file path from potentially untrusted data, which can lead to a path        
          traversal vulnerability. An attacker can manipulate the path which the application uses to access   
          files. If the application does not validate user input and sanitize file paths, sensitive files such
          as configuration or user data can be accessed, potentially creating or overwriting files. To prevent
          this vulnerability, validate and sanitize any input that is used to create references to file paths.
          Also, enforce strict file access controls. For example, choose privileges allowing public-facing    
          applications to access only the required files.
